# Cosmos Project

I start this project to recall what I was responsable of in past when I was an engineer in SSRC (or symply TsSKB/ЦСКБ).

## Gravity

First and main part of satellite's formula is Gravity. 
I take [Холщевников, 2003] algorithm from [Бородовицына, Авдюшев].

To test realization I take results of calculation for two models : gem4 and egm96 from [GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de).


To statrt tests simply run "python test" in the project's root.
